<h1>Electron React Desktop App </h1> 
<hr>
<p> This is a Desktop App based on a boiler plate by Alex Devero. The boiler plate makes it easy to start developing an electron app with out having to do much set-up.
</p>
<h3> Motivation </h3>
<p>I often download pdf files to my computer and lose track of them because they end up in folders and sub-folders that are easy to ignore. This personal App shorten the time spent looking through folders and sub-folders by just scanning a main directory. All pdf files will be displayed in a grid system where each pdf is a double-clickable cell that allows the user to open the pdf.
